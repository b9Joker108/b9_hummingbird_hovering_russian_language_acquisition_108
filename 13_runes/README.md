# Slavic Runes & Pre-Cyrillic Writing Systems

*Древние письмена - Ancient Writings*

## Overview

This module explores pre-Cyrillic writing systems used by Slavic peoples, including runic inscriptions, proto-alphabetic symbols, and the transition to Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts. Understanding these ancient systems provides deep spatio-temporal context for Russian linguistic and cultural development.

## Historical Context

### Pre-Christian Writing Systems

Before the adoption of Christianity and the creation of Glagolitic/Cyrillic alphabets by Saints Cyril and Methodius (863 CE), Slavic peoples used various writing and marking systems:

1. **Proto-Slavic Symbols** (pre-9th century)
2. **Runic Influences** (Scandinavian-Slavic contact)
3. **Magical and Divination Marks**
4. **Tally and Property Marks** (ownership symbols)

## Types of Pre-Cyrillic Systems

### 1. Slavic Runes (Руны)

#### Characteristics
- Linear geometric forms
- Sacred and practical uses
- Regional variations
- Connection to Old Church Slavonic

#### Evidence Sources
- Novgorod birch bark documents (берестяные грамоты)
- Archaeological findings
- Church chronicles mentioning "черты и резы" (lines and cuts)
- Rock inscriptions

### 2. "Cherty i Rezy" (Черты и Резы)

**Meaning**: "Lines and Cuts"

Referenced in the medieval monk Chrabr's account:
> *"Прежде убо словѣне не имѣху книгъ, нъ чрътами и рѣзами чьтѣху и гатааху"*
> "Before, the Slavs did not have books, but read and divined by means of lines and cuts"

#### Features
- Notch-based system
- Used for counting and records
- Magical/divinatory purposes
- Simple geometric marks

### 3. Glagolitic Precursors

Before Glagolitic alphabet (oldest Slavic alphabet), various transitional forms existed:
- Proto-alphabetic experiments
- Adaptations of Greek letters
- Mixed symbolic systems

## Runic Vocabulary (Russian)

| Russian | Transliteration | English |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| руна | runa | rune |
| письмена | pismena | writings, letters |
| черта | cherta | line, mark |
| рез | rez | cut, notch |
| вязь | vyaz' | ligature, interweaving |
| знак | znak | sign, symbol |
| символ | simvol | symbol |
| древность | drevnost' | antiquity |
| язычество | yazychestvo | paganism |
| оберег | obereg | protective charm |
| волхв | volkhv | pagan priest, magus |

## Specific Runic Systems

### 1. Veles Book Controversy (Велесова книга)

**Status**: Authenticity disputed
**Claims**: Ancient Slavic text in runic script
**Importance**: Whether authentic or not, represents cultural interest in pre-Christian Slavic heritage

### 2. Archaeological Runes

Confirmed findings:
- **Alekanovskaya inscription** (10th century)
- **Novgorod inscriptions** (various periods)
- **Gnezdovo inscription** (10th century)

### 3. Sacred Symbols

Pre-Christian Slavic sacred symbols that influenced later Orthodox Christian art:
- **Коловрат** (Kolovrat) - solar wheel
- **Свастика** (Svastika) - ancient sun symbol (pre-Nazi appropriation)
- **Триглав** (Triglav) - triple deity symbol
- **Родовик** (Rodovik) - family/lineage symbol

## Transition to Cyrillic

### Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-863 CE | Various runic and symbolic systems |
| 863 CE | Glagolitic alphabet created by St. Cyril |
| Late 9th C | Early Cyrillic emerges from Glagolitic |
| 10th C | Cyrillic spreads through Kievan Rus' |
| 988 CE | Christianization of Rus' - Cyrillic dominates |
| 11-12th C | Church Slavonic standardizes |

### Why Runes Faded

1. **Christianization** - Church literacy in Cyrillic
2. **Standardization** - Unified alphabet for liturgical texts
3. **Prestige** - Byzantine cultural influence
4. **Practicality** - More comprehensive alphabet for Slavic sounds

## Cultural Significance

### In Orthodox Context

While pre-Christian runes were largely replaced, their cultural memory persists:
- **Theological Continuity**: The Logos (Слово) sanctifies all writing
- **Artistic Motifs**: Geometric patterns in church decoration
- **Folk Memory**: Preserved in folklore and traditional arts
- **Historical Awareness**: Understanding the pre-Christian context

### Modern Revival

Contemporary interest in Slavic runes:
- **Academic Study**: Historical linguistics and archaeology
- **Cultural Identity**: Slavic heritage movements
- **Artistic Expression**: Modern calligraphy and design
- **Spiritual Seeking**: Neo-pagan movements (distinguish from Orthodox Christianity)

## Learning Activities

### 1. Comparative Analysis
Compare runic forms with Glagolitic and Cyrillic letters:
- Identify geometric similarities
- Understand evolutionary relationships
- Practice writing historical forms

### 2. Reading Practice
Transliterate known runic inscriptions:
- Gnezdovo inscription
- Archaeological pottery marks
- Medieval "черты и резы"

### 3. Cultural Context
Study how pre-Christian and Christian traditions merged:
- Dual faith period (двоеверие)
- Syncretism in folk practices
- Orthodox Christian transformation of pagan sites

## Theological Perspective

### Orthodox Christian Understanding

From an Orthodox perspective, the study of pre-Christian runes is understood through:

1. **Historical Pedagogy**: "All truth is God's truth"
2. **Cultural Context**: Understanding what was transformed by Christianity
3. **Missionary Awareness**: How Saints Cyril and Methodius engaged existing culture
4. **Spiritual Discernment**: Distinguishing academic study from occult practices

**Important Distinction**: 
- ✓ **Academic/Historical Study**: Understanding cultural heritage
- ✗ **Divination/Magic**: Incompatible with Orthodox faith

## Primary Sources

### Medieval References
- **Chrabr's "On Letters"** (О письменех) - 9th-10th century
- **Thietmar of Merseburg's Chronicle** - mentions Slavic temple inscriptions
- **Russian Primary Chronicle** - references to pre-Christian practices

### Archaeological Evidence
- Novgorod birch bark documents
- Gnezdovo burial finds
- Pottery and tool markings
- Stone inscriptions
