## Indo-European Heritage

### Proto-Indo-European Roots

**Family**: Russian belongs to Indo-European language family
**Branch**: Balto-Slavic (disputed) or independent Slavic branch
**Relatives**: 
- Close: Ukrainian, Belarusian, Polish, Czech
- Distant: Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, Germanic, Celtic

**Shared Features**:
- Case system (inherited from PIE)
- Verb conjugation patterns
- Core vocabulary (family terms, numbers, nature)
- Ablaut (vowel gradation)

### Common Slavic Period

**Approximate Date**: 500-1000 CE
**Characteristics**:
- Mutual intelligibility among Slavic speakers
- Common phonological features
- Shared mythology and culture
- Pre-Christian traditions

**Major Sound Changes**:
- First palatalization of velars (k, g, x → č, ž, š before front vowels)
- Rise of nasal vowels (later lost in East Slavic)
- Development of soft/hard consonant distinction

**Split into Three Groups**:
1. **East Slavic**: Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian
2. **West Slavic**: Polish, Czech, Slovak
3. **South Slavic**: Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian

## Old East Slavic (Древнерусский язык)

### Period: ~1000-1400 CE

**Political Context**: Kievan Rus' (882-1240)
**Religious Context**: Baptism of Rus' (988) - pivotal transformation

**Key Events**:
- **988 CE**: Christianization - Church Slavonic introduced
- **9th-10th C**: Glagolitic/Cyrillic alphabets
- **11-12th C**: Golden age of Kievan culture
- **1240**: Mongol invasion begins

### Diglossia: Church Slavonic & Vernacular

**Church Slavonic** (Церковнославянский):
- Liturgical and literary language
- Based on Old Bulgarian (South Slavic)
- Brought by Byzantine missionaries
- High prestige
- Used for religious texts, chronicles, law codes

**Old East Slavic Vernacular**:
- Spoken language
- Daily documents
- Birch bark documents (берестяные грамоты)
- Legal texts (Russian Truth - Русская Правда)
- Chronicles (Primary Chronicle - Повесть временных лет)

**Bilingualism Effect**:
- Church Slavonic provided abstract/theological vocabulary
- Vernacular for concrete/everyday terms
- Created linguistic stratification still present today
- Literary language emerged from synthesis

### Phonological Features

**Distinctive Features**:
- **Full vowels** (jer vowels) still pronounced:
  - ъ [ə] (hard jer)
  - ь [ĭ] (soft jer)
  - Later disappeared or became о/е
- **Nasal vowels** beginning to denasalize
  - ѧ [ẽ] → я [ja]
  - ѫ [õ] → у [u]

### Grammatical Features

**More Complex Than Modern Russian**:
- **Dual number**: Special forms for "two items"
  - *очи* (two eyes), *руцѣ* (two hands)
